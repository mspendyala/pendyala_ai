Under sage \\nVashistha\\'s guidance, they excelled themselves in archery, riding \\nand hunting. They also learnt about the holy books and how to look \\nafter the welfare of the people. They respected their Gurus and the \\nelders and gained the love and affection of people of Ayodhya. \\nThe brothers loved each other very much too. Lakshmana was a very \\nclose companion to Rama.Bharatha and Shatrugna were the other \\ntwo inseparables. \\n \\nKing Dasharatha felt very proud of his sons. One day he was \\ndiscussing with sage Vashishta about finding suitable brides for his \\nsons. At that time a great sage called Vishwamitra came to the court \\nof Dasharatha. The king was very happy to welcome him Ayodhya. \\nAfter extending a warm hospitality he asked Vishwamitra \"O great \\nsage! Your visit has made me a very happy. Pray, tell me the \\npurpose of your visit. I shall deem it a great honour to abide by your \\nwish.\" \\n \\nVishwamitra, pleased with the king\\'s words told him \"King \\nDasharatha! I am pleased with your hospitality. I have heard that \\nyou always keep up your word. That\\'s why I am here. I about to \\nperform a yagna but two Rakshasas, Mareecha and Subahu, pour \\nblood and human flesh on the fire pit and pollute the Yagna. I cannot \\ncast any curse on them as I am involved in sacred work. But I \\ncannot perform the yagna till these demons are killed.Rama, your \\nson, is the only valiant person who can kill them. Hence, please send \\nhim with me for ten days. As soon as the yagna is completed, I will \\nsend back Rama to Ayodhya.\"  \\n \\nWhen aged king heard this request, he felt nervous about sending \\nhis young son to fight against the demons. “Respect Sage\", \\nHe pleaded with Vishwamitra, \"My dear son Rama is still very young. \\nHow can he fight against the Rakshass? Instead of Rama, I will send \\nmy entire army to help you in conducting yagna. I cannot bear to be \\nseparated from Rama and hence please spare me this agony.\" \\nVishwamitra was angry at Dasharatha\\'s words.\"O king, you are \\ngoing back on your word.

Under sage \\nVashistha\\'s guidance, they excelled themselves in archery, riding \\nand hunting. They also learnt about the holy books and how to look \\nafter the welfare of the people. They respected their Gurus and the \\nelders and gained the love and affection of people of Ayodhya. \\nThe brothers loved each other very much too. Lakshmana was a very \\nclose companion to Rama.Bharatha and Shatrugna were the other \\ntwo inseparables. \\n \\nKing Dasharatha felt very proud of his sons. One day he was \\ndiscussing with sage Vashishta about finding suitable brides for his \\nsons. At that time a great sage called Vishwamitra came to the court \\nof Dasharatha. The king was very happy to welcome him Ayodhya. \\nAfter extending a warm hospitality he asked Vishwamitra \"O great \\nsage! Your visit has made me a very happy. Pray, tell me the \\npurpose of your visit. I shall deem it a great honour to abide by your \\nwish.\" \\n \\nVishwamitra, pleased with the king\\'s words told him \"King \\nDasharatha! I am pleased with your hospitality. I have heard that \\nyou always keep up your word. That\\'s why I am here. I about to \\nperform a yagna but two Rakshasas, Mareecha and Subahu, pour \\nblood and human flesh on the fire pit and pollute the Yagna. I cannot \\ncast any curse on them as I am involved in sacred work. But I \\ncannot perform the yagna till these demons are killed.Rama, your \\nson, is the only valiant person who can kill them. Hence, please send \\nhim with me for ten days. As soon as the yagna is completed, I will \\nsend back Rama to Ayodhya.\"  \\n \\nWhen aged king heard this request, he felt nervous about sending \\nhis young son to fight against the demons. “Respect Sage\", \\nHe pleaded with Vishwamitra, \"My dear son Rama is still very young. \\nHow can he fight against the Rakshass?

Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”.'), ('39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces.
